this is the app that i want  use to build. '2.	Real-Time Collaborative Whiteboard
o	Project: A simple whiteboard where multiple users can draw simultaneously.
o	Why Vue? Paired with Vue's reactivity, it's easy to update the canvas in real-time. The Composition API is great for managing drawing logic.
o	Backend: FastAPI. Excellent for handling WebSocket connections for real-time communication with high performance.
'. i would like it to work in this way, users do not need to login/create accounts they will just visit the website and create a 'board'(resembling a meeting) by this they can then share the 'board' link to other people who can they join the 'board' and when they join the board without restrictions or approvals users can then write down information in the whitepage/whiteboard whose info will have a 'ring-1' of different colors for different users to signify whose note it is, and also they can draw content in the board at any position and color the content/shapes.at the users page they will have a short info of the members in the meeting and their signified colors accordingly for ease in pinpointing who is who. i have already set up vue(were using pinia and tailwindcss + daisyui only for stylishing, notivue@2.4.5 for notification), and fastapi i have the main.py file. i would like you to start creating this project step by step explaining what your doing.additionally if ther is other library that you want to put in place dont forget to mention code for its installation
